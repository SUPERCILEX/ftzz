`files-exact` and `bytes-exact` can be used together:

```console
$ ftzz generate -n 1K -b 100 --files-exact --bytes-exact all-exact-explicit
Exactly 1,000 files will be generated in approximately 1,000 directories distributed across a tree of maximum depth 5 where each directory contains approximately 4 other directories. Each file will contain approximately 0 bytes of random data totaling exactly 100 bytes.
Created 1,000 files (100 B) across 1,018 directories.

```

Flat dir:

```console
$ ftzz generate -n 1K --depth 0 flat
About 1,000 files will be generated in approximately 1 directory distributed across a tree of maximum depth 0 where each directory contains approximately 0 other directories.
Created 1,034 files across 0 directories.

```

Info output:

```console
$ ftzz generate -vv -n 1K verbose
About 1,000 files will be generated in approximately 1,000 directories distributed across a tree of maximum depth 5 where each directory contains approximately 4 other directories.
